# Shukumei

Shukumei means fate, and what are dice for but for deciding your fate?

This is a simple dice bot configured specifically for using in discord for those running Legend of the Five Rings 5th Edition games (Created by Edge Studios under license of Fantasy Flight Games). 

Developed with the assistance of Logos who provided commentary and useful ideas. You know who you are :)

## FAQ

* Want me to make it work for other editions? I have no plans to unfortunately.
* Have a feature idea? I'll consider it depending on how complicated it is. :)
