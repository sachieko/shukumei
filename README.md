# Shukumei 

Shukumei means fate, and what are dice for but for deciding your fate? <img src="./assets/shukumei-avatar.png" height="100" align="left" alt="shukumei-bot">

This is a simple dice bot configured specifically for using in discord for those running [Legend of the Five Rings 5th Edition (Created by Edge Studios under license of Fantasy Flight Games)](https://www.edge-studio.net/games/l5r-core-rulebook/).

There are also some additional commands I am developing for convenience.

Developed with the assistance of Logos who provided commentary and useful ideas. You know who you are :)

## Working Commands

* Ping: Confirm the bot is working and responding
* Predict: Predict the stance another user in discord will take on their next turn, revealing only at the end.

### Commands in Development
* Roll: Perform a roll given a starting amount of ring and skill dice as well as keeping dice, inccluding whether assistance was given or void points spent.
* Staredown: Conceals both duelists bids, revealing them only at the end.

## FAQ

* Want me to make it work for other editions? I have no plans to unfortunately.
* Have a feature idea? I'll consider it depending on how complicated it is. :)
